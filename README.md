This is an example project using Rust to program the BLE651, which uses an NRF52810 chip.

## Tests

  * Compilation and flashing the chip
  * Blinking an LED
  * Using an LSM303AGR eCompass module from ST Microelectronics via I2C (TWI)
  * Writing to text to UART
  * reading the internal temperature sensor
